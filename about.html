                            &emsp;Hello There! My name is Jaydon Carter, I'm a Computer Science student at Southern Utah University. I was born in Virginia and raised in Germany, California, and Utah. I blend my love of coding with a passion for the outdoors, whether it’s sending tree runs at a ski resort or coding a new Python project.<br>
                            &emsp;My passion for computers originated in high school, I loved playing video games with my friends, and wanted to learn more about the systems that allowed for their creation and the computers that supported them. Since then, I've taught myself and experimented with different programming languages, such as Lua and Python, customized operating systems in Linux, and created websites and projects.
